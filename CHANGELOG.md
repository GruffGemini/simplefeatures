# Changelog

## v0.1.0

Initial tagged version.

## v0.2.0

- The `Intersects` method is now implemented for all geometry pairs. The method
  signature has been changed to no longer return an error (errors were only
returned for unimplemented geometry pairs).

## v0.3.0

- A Linesweep algorithm is now used for the `Intersects() bool` implementation
  between line types (`Line`, `LineString`, `MultiLineString`). This reduces
the computational complexity from quadratic time to linearithmic time.

## v0.4.0

- The `Geometry` interface has been replaced with a concrete type also named
  `Geometry`. This new type holds exactly one geometry value (one of
`EmptySet`, `Point`, `Line`, `LineString`, `Polygon`, `MultiPoint`,
`MultiLineString`, `MultiPolygon`, `GeometryCollection`. The `AnyGeometry` type
has been removed (`Geometry` can be used instead).
